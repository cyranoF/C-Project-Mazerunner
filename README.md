# C-Project-Mazerunner
Mazerunner in Command window

A Mini-Project in C using the Command windows. It is in German.

To play you need to execute the "Miniprojekt.exe" in the "Debug" Folder. Depending on the ASCII on your computer it may appear bugged, I used the German and Brazilian one and worked.

In the Command Windows you can select the LvL by typing the number and move using the Arrow-Keys. There is a limited number of moves before reseting, so be careful!

Enjoy!
